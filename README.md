# Self Promotion Post Generator

Python tool to generate and post fake self-promotional material to LinkedIn. Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate fake self-promotional material text and images and then posts them to LinkedIn.

## Installation

You must first create an OpenAI account and get an API key. Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key to it. See the file named `env.example` for example.

Then run `main.py` and the generated images and text will be placed in the `posts` directory.
